## Intro
Allergenius is an app designed to help people experiencing allergic reaaction to track their symptoms as well as the food they have consumed.  Users can then share this information with a healthcare professional in order to facilitate a diagnosis of what food(s) they are allergic to.

## Design Process
At the begining of our design process, we decided which features would be part of our MVP (most viable product) and which features would be part of Phase 2 or Phase 3 of development. Github Projects was used in order to create the tasks that all the team members worked on.  Erin's main contribution was to the authentication portion of the website.  Kayla's main contribution was to the React components and styling.  Sarah's main contribution was to the home page and the large React calendar. Niki's main contribution was to the backend MySQL database and routes.
