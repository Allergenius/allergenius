## Intro
Allergenius is an app designed to help people experiencing allergic reaction to track their symptoms as well as the food they have consumed.  Users can then share this information with a healthcare professional in order to facilitate a diagnosis of what food(s) they are allergic to.\
  
## Design Process
At the begining of our design process, we decided which features would be part of our MVP (most viable product) and which features would be part of Phase 2 or Phase 3 of development. Github Projects was used in order to create the tasks that all the team members worked on.\
  
## Individual Contributions
Although we all helped in all areas of the website, there were main focuses that each team member had:

- Erin: User authentication, Heroku setup, debugging, and styling.  
- Kayla: React components and forms, documentation, debugging, and styling.  
- Sarah: React pages, implementing the reaction calendar, Heroku setup, and debugging. 
- Niki: backend MySQL schema, routes, documentation, debugging, and implementing export to CSV functionality.\

## Future Development
Our thoughts for future development include:
- adding the option to export reactions to PDF as well as CSV
- creating filter options so that users can choose a date range to export instead of exporting all reactions
- adding the ability to upload photos of reactions to be included in the exported file for the medical professionals
- building a graph of reactions so user can see patterns
- adding the option to edit reactions as well as delete them
- allowing the user to delete their profile and all data from the app
- adding educational tips and links in a resources section of the app
- changing logic so users can rate the severity of each type of reaction they're experiencing rather than give an overall severity rating
- incorporating sliding range bars rather than radio buttons for better UX
