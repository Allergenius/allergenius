![Allergenius: Allergic Reaction Logging App](client/src/assets/images/allergenius_logo_readme.png) 

## Intro
[Allergenius](https://allergenius-demo.herokuapp.com) is an allergic reaction logging app designed to allow users to track symptoms as well as foods they have consumed. Users can then share this information with a healthcare professional in order to facilitate a diagnosis of what food(s) they are allergic to.  
  
## Design Process
At the begining of our design process, we decided which features would be part of our MVP (most viable product) and which features would be part of Phase 2 or Phase 3 of development. Github Projects was used in order to create the tasks that all the team members worked on.  
  
## Individual Contributions
Although we all helped in nearlye very area of the app, our main duties includes:
- [Erin Clancy](https://github.com/noplanetnoparty): User authentication, Heroku setup, debugging, and styling.
- [Kayla Himmelberger](https://github.com/kaylahimmel): React components and forms, documentation, debugging, and styling.
- [Sarah Lopriore](https://github.com/sarahlopriore): React pages, implementing the reaction calendar, Heroku setup, and debugging.
- [Nicholette Sams](https://github.com/nicholettesams): backend MySQL schema, routes, documentation, debugging, and implementing the calendar export to CSV functionality.

## Future Development
Our thoughts for future development include:
- incorporating MyFitnessPal and/or other third-party APIs to automatically pull in user's food intake and activity data rather than asking the user to input those manually
- adding the option to export reactions to PDF as well as CSV
- styling the CSV and PDF exports in a more readable format
- creating filter options for the calendar export option so that users can choose a date range to export as well as the ability to export all reactions
- adding the ability to upload photos of reactions to be included in the exported file for medical professionals
- building a graph of reactions so user can see patterns over time
- adding the option to modify reactions as well as delete them
- including notification functionality that asks the user 4 hours after logging a reaction whether they are still experiencing the symptoms
- allowing the user to delete their profile and all data from the app
- adding a resources section that includes educational tips and links to external sites
- changing the logic so users can rate the severity of each type of symptom they're experiencing rather than give an overall severity rating
- incorporating sliding range bars rather than radio buttons for better UX
